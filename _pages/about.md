I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Waterloo, member of the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), supervised by Professor [Pascal Poupart](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/). My research interests are in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing and my focus is on Reliable Machine Learning using Causal Inference and Deep Representation Learning.  

Previously I was a Senior Research Engineer at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab where I worked on Machine Translation, Natural Language Understanding, Adversarial Algorithms and Model Compression. I completed my Master's degree at McGill, working on semi-supervised learning, under the supervision of Professor [Yannis Psaromiligkos](https://psaromiligkos.gitlab.io/) and Professor [Roussos Dimitrakopoulos](https://www.mcgill.ca/mining/people-0/faculty/roussos-dimitrakopoulos). I was also to work with Professor [Luc Devroye](http://luc.devroye.org/) during the summer of 2015. My undergraduate was in Electrical Engineering at McGill and I was supervised by Professor Jan Bajcsy for my Honor's thesis.
